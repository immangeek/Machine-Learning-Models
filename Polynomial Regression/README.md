# Polynomial Regression
I did this kind of regression model with the `help` of the *Salaries* Data
Which was their position,level and salary

---
| Position | Level | Salary |
| ---      | ---   | ---    |
| Business Analyst | 1 | 45000 |
| Manager  | 4 | 80000 |
| Manager  | 4 | 80000 |
| Partner  | 7 | 200000 |
